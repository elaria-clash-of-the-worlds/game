## `📖` `About Elaria`
[Elaria - Clash of the Worlds](https://elaria.anafro.ru/) - my first game created on [my own game engine](https://github.com/elaria-clash-of-the-worlds/engine). 
You are a bouble, a magical creature created from love and nature living on Elaria, a beautiful planet located far away in space. But one day, people've come on your planet
to steal its resources and stole... you?!

## `▶️` `Deployment`
Just clone the repository. The game is located in the `index.html` file, since this is a browser game.
